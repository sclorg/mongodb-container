# Run mongod in a StatefulSet-based replica set. See
# https://github.com/sclorg/mongodb-container/blob/master/examples/petset/README.md
# for a description of how this is intended to work.
#
# Note:
# - It does not attempt to remove the host from the replica set configuration
#   when it is terminating. That is by design, because, in a StatefulSet, when a
#   pod/container terminates and is restarted by OpenShift, it will always have
#   the same hostname. Removing hosts from the configuration affects replica set
#   elections and can impact the replica set stability.
